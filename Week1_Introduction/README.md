'Environment Setup'

This section is for outlining steps for configuring development environment with preference to Linux OS. For that matter, we are renting an Ubuntu server on AWS and setting up the environment to suit our need.

Note: I am on Windows Laptop, hence all the configurations done locally are pertaining to Windows OS only.

**Phase 1: EC2 Instance

    - Go to AWS Console to spin up an EC2 instance of Ubuntu flavour of t2.xlarge size.
    - Download the secret access keys (.pem file)
    - Take a note of the public IP
